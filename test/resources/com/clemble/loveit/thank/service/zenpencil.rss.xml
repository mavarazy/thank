What’s your New Year’s resolution? <a href="https://zenpencils.com/comic/asimov/">Travel more?</a> Maybe<a href="https://zenpencils.com/comic/poe/">write that book?</a> Perhaps<a href="https://zenpencils.com/comic/160-edgar-albert-guest-it-couldnt-be-done/">run a marathon?</a> Take up<a href="https://zenpencils.com/comic/rhodes/">piano again?</a> Start a Side Hustle? &#8220;What exactly is a Side Hustle?&#8221; I hear you ask. Well, it’s basically a way to generate extra income without quitting your job. The term was popularised by my friend Chris Guillebeau, whose new book<em><a href="https://sidehustleschool.com/#">SIDE HUSTLE: From Idea to Income in 27 Days</a></em> was released a few months ago. He also hosts a podcast called <em><a href="https://sidehustleschool.com/#">Side Hustle School</a></em>, which updates every day, with each episode featuring an example of someone’s successful Side Hustle (including a woman who started a cat sitting service, which is where I got the idea for this comic from). </p><p>The not quitting your job part is important here. I quit my job back at the end of 2011, before launching <em>Zen Pencils</em> at the start of 2012 (six year anniversary at the end of the month!). Thankfully it worked out for me, but looking back on it, it was insanely risky. I had a supportive wife and no kids, but I did have a mortgage that we got rid of by selling our house and going back to renting for a period (like I said, supportive wife). So yeah, if you do have a passion project or idea for a new business, check out Chris’s book and podcast to get some guidance first before you do something crazy like quitting your job and selling your home like I did.</p><p><img src="https://zenpencils.com/wp-content/uploads/COVER200.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="245" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5302" />Speaking of books and paying mortgages, my new <em>Zen Pencils</em> collection is out on the 16th January!<strong><em><a href="https://zenpencils.com/struggle/">CREATIVE STRUGGLE: Illustrated Advice from Masters of Creativity</a></em></strong> collects creative advice from the likes of Stephen King, Albert Einstein, Vincent Van Gogh, Marie Curie, Brené Brown and myself (I did an exclusive comic for the book explaining my 8 tips for living a creative life). It would mean a lot if you pre-ordered and helped spread the word. All the details <a href="https://zenpencils.com/struggle/">are on this page,</a> and if you do pre-order you go into the running to win a<em>Zen Pencils</em> prize pack of signed books and a piece of original art. Thank you and all the best for 2018!</p><p><strong>RELATED POSTS</strong><em><br />

                <![CDATA[<p>Hello lovely readers! </p><p>Jeez, can you believe it’s the end of year already? When the hell did that happen?? How has your year been? Mine has been pretty … steady. Career-wise, I’ve continued to work hard on <em>Zen Pencils</em> – most of the year has been spent working on comics that will form part of my new book collection, which I’ll tell you more about later. Personally things have been great, my daughter is keeping me busy and I’ve been helping look after her more as my wife returned to work. I’ve probably struggled a bit to find a good work/life balance &#8211; working from home and having a cute little human running around does mean my productivity has dropped a little. But it’s one of the main reasons I quit my job all those years ago to start<em>Zen Pencils</em>, to have more time for family and life so it&#8217;s all good.<span id="more-5295"></span></p><p>I’m really excited about 2018. To be honest, I was feeling a bit burnt out creatively recently and wasn’t sure if I could continue <em>Zen Pencils</em>. After over 5 years and 200 comics I was wondering if I had taken this site as far as I can. But after my<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BcM-AEXF2IA/?hl=en&#038;taken-by=zenpencils">recent trip to India,</a> and meeting some amazing readers, that really gave me the kick up the butt I needed. It reminded me that I had built something special and meaningful to a lot of people, and the trip inspired me to keep going. Now I’ve got lots of new ideas to explore next year and I can’t wait to get started (I probably just needed to just get out of the house, I was turning into a cranky cartooning recluse here at home!).</p><p>So onwards to 2018! I’d like to thank each and every one of you for your support over the years, of if you’re a new reader, then thanks for coming onboard.<em> Zen Pencils</em> turns 6 in February – its become my life, my sometimes enemy and my constant refuge. I hope you stick around!</p><p><strong>The most popular comics of 2017 </strong><br />
Below are the top five comics of the year, judged solely on traffic. Here’s the list of all my <a href="https://zenpencils.com/newreaders/">previous top comics.</a><br /><img src="https://zenpencils.com/wp-content/uploads/post580.jpg" alt="" width="580" height="326" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5296" /> </p><p><a href="https://zenpencils.com/comic/king/">1. STEPHEN KING &#8211; The Desk:</a> Definitely my favourite of the year too. This was a pleasure to create and Mr King posting it on his Facebook page was a real treat for a lifelong fan like me.<br /><a href="https://zenpencils.com/comic/bowie/">2. DAVID BOWIE &#8211; Go a Little Further:</a> I really took a lot from this quote. Bowie’s advice of never playing it safe and to keep pushing one self is something I hope to practice next year. Plus, it was fun drawing the coked-out Thin White Duke.<br /><a href="https://zenpencils.com/comic/kurosawa/">3. AKIRA KUROSAWA &#8211; The Note Taker:</a> I admit, I still read in bed<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f641.png" alt="🙁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Some great books I read in 2017 were <em>Leonardo Da Vinci</em> (Isaacson),<em>Sapiens</em> (Harari),<em>Side Hustle</em> (Guillebeau),<em>Hiroshima</em> (Hersey),<em>The Devil in the White City</em> (Larson),<em>The Old Man and the Sea</em> (Hemingway),<em>The Whites</em> (Brandt),<em>Dream Team</em> (MaCallum),<em>Golden Days</em> (MaCallum),<em>Red Harvest</em> (Hammett),<em> The North Water</em> (McGuire).<br /><a href="https://zenpencils.com/comic/fridakahlo/">4. FRIDA KAHLO &#8211; Heroine of Pain:</a> It’s hard not to be inspired by Frida’s story and the popularity of this comic shows how much of icon she still is.<br /><a href="https://zenpencils.com/comic/brenebrown/">5. BRENÉ BROWN &#8211; The Eternal Struggle:</a> A sequel to my<a href="https://zenpencils.com/comic/139-brene-brown-the-woman-in-the-arena/">first adaptation</a> of a BB quote and a fun little story on how to conquer your inner demon.</p><p><strong>Have you pre-ordered my new book yet?</strong><br /><img src="https://zenpencils.com/wp-content/uploads/Prize_580.jpg" alt="" width="580" height="580" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5297" /><br />
The comics above appear in my new book collection <em>CREATIVE STRUGGLE: Illustrated Advice From Masters of Creativity!</em> It’s released on January 16, 2018. If you pre-order before then, you go into the running to win a Zen Pencils prize pack (pictured above) of signed copies of all of my books and an original, one-of-a-kind ink drawing featuring some of<em>Zen Pencils </em>most popular characters. You can see the full details of the book and competition here. I know it’s Christmas and you’re probably down to your last penny after all the Christmas shopping, but I bet you didn’t get anything for yourself. C’mon, you deserve a little gift after making it through this hell of a year, so I highly recommend you to treat yo’ self to my new book<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p><p>Have a happy and safe holidays!<br />

A struggling poet, artist and print-maker, unrecognised during his lifetime, Blake is now considered one of the most important figures in English literature.<em>A Poison Tree</em> first appeared in his<em>Songs of Experience</em> collection in 1794.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Poison_Tree#/media/File:Songsie.b.p48-49.300.jpg">Here’s his original piece.</a></p><p>I’ve done so many inspirational comics &#8230; that it’s hard not to repeat myself. After my recent bunch of comics focusing on creativity I felt like doing something different and this poem has been on my mind for awhile. Reader Jen emailed it to me years ago and I had no idea how to adapt it, so I kept it in my “to-do” file. Cut to about a month ago and I saw that Rose McGowan <a href="https://twitter.com/rosemcgowan/status/919282639160320001/photo/1">tweeted the poem</a> with no explanation amidst the Harvey Weinstein sexual assault scandal. That gave me a direction on how I could adapt the poem. And then a<a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-11-08/the-horrors-of-the-evil-8-and-how-a-young-girl-was-preyed-upon/9127046">horrific story broke</a> in my home town of Perth about a father who farmed his daughter out to be sexually abused by various men which made me so angry and turned the comic even darker. I know this might be jarring for some readers. It’s not uplifting, inspirational or zen, but it’s a story that came out of me that I felt compelled to draw.</p><p><strong>MORE POETRY ADAPTATIONS</strong><br /><em><a href="https://zenpencils.com/comic/shakespeare/">All the World’s a Stage</a></em> &#8211; Shakespeare<br /><em><a href="https://zenpencils.com/comic/124-taylor-mali-what-teachers-make/">What Teachers Make</a></em> &#8211; Taylor Mali<br /><em><a href="https://zenpencils.com/comic/131-c-p-cavafy-ithaka/">Ithaka</a></em> &#8211; C.P.

Don&#8217;t we all? I’m fighting it right now &#8211; I don’t really enjoy writing these blog posts underneath each comic and I always put it off to until the last minute. I know I must do it, but I really don’t want to. As I sat down to write this, my computer was lagging a bit, so I restarted it. Got up to use the bathroom, decided on the way to the bathroom that I needed to fix myself some tea, then paused to read the mail on my kitchen table and of course I had to check the GREATEST PROCRASTINATION MACHINE THE WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN: my phone. Next thing I know, one hour has passed and I still haven’t started writing.</p><p>At least this is not a <em>new</em> phenomenon &#8211; Edgar Allan Poe wrote the above words in 1845 and I&#8217;m sure an early homo sapien kept putting off a cave painting he knew he had to do thousands of years ago. This passage is taken from Poe&#8217;s short story<em>The Imp of the Perverse</em>, the name he gives the creature who forces us to do things we know we shouldn’t. The story is about a man who gets away with murder, and after inheriting his victim’s estate and enjoying his new life for years he inevitably falls victim to the Imp yet again, as he can&#8217;t help confessing his crime. Poe conveys it much more eloquently than I do and you can read the entire story<a href="https://www.eapoe.org/works/tales/impa.htm">here.</a></p><p>Don’t let the Imp get you today, do what you need to get done!</p><p class="print"><a href="https://shopzenpencils.com/products/procrastination">BUY THE POSTER</a></p><p class="notes">A new <em>Zen Pencils</em> kids book is released next week, collecting the best kid-friendly comics of my site into one easy to read book, perfect for story time or the classroom. You can find all the details and<a href="https://zenpencils.com/kidsbook/">pre-order info here.</a></p>

BRENÉ BROWN: The eternal struggle"><img width="19" height="96" src="https://cdn-zenpencils.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/216_brene1.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" /></a></p><p>This is the second quote from Brené Brown that I&#8217;ve adapted and a semi-sequel to <em><a href="https://zenpencils.com/comic/139-brene-brown-the-woman-in-the-arena/">The Woman in the Arena.</a></em> Brené specialises in creativity, vulnerability and shame and in the <a href="http://brenebrown.com/2011/05/03/201153to-live-a-creative-life-html/">blog post</a> where this quote is taken from (it also appears in her best-selling book<em>The Gifts of Imperfection</em>) she writes that like many others, she was disconnected from her creativity until she actively made an effort to embrace it again and make it a part of her life.</p><p>And I know, it does sound a bit privileged and pretentious for me to tell people to find time to be creative in today&#8217;s world. <em>&#8220;Jeez Gav, I have a full-time job, two kids and a house that needs cleaning. I don&#8217;t exactly have time to set up the easel and paint a still-life.&#8221;</em> I get that, but I&#8217;m not telling you to complete the next<em>Mona Lisa</em> or write<em>War and Peace</em>. It could be as small as baking a cake for your kid&#8217;s birthday, drawing an anniversary card for your spouse instead of buying one,<a href="https://zenpencils.com/comic/rhodes/">taking up the piano again after years of not practicing,</a> having a karaoke battle with your friends &#8211; it seriously doesn&#8217;t matter.</p><p>And yes, if you haven&#8217;t tried it before or have neglected art for years, your initial attempts will be awful. <a href="https://zenpencils.com/comic/90-ira-glass-advice-for-beginners/">Absolutely horrible.</a> But that&#8217;s ok. Just do it for yourself and not to impress anyone. Just have a bit of fun and don&#8217;t let that battered and bruised creative spirit inside you die out completely.</p><p><strong>RELATED COMICS</strong><br />

As a 13 year-old boy in India, he was not ‘discovered’ by a record producer or casting agent, but by one of the leaders of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theosophical_Society">Theosophical Society.</a> The young boy was proclaimed as the next “World Teacher”, a Christ-like figure that the society had predicted would lead humanity to peace and understanding. The Society took legal guardianship of Jiddu and his brother and began preparing Krishnamurti for his destiny. He was named head of The Order of the Star in the East, an organisation specifically formed to ready the world for its new saviour and Krishnamurti spent the next 19 years travelling with the Theosophical Society, giving lectures and being an obedient Saviour in-waiting.</p><p>Then in 1929, speaking before the Order of the Star members, the 32 year-old Krishnamurti renounced his destiny and dissolved the organisation. In what must have been a legendary mic-drop moment, he said:</p><p><strong><em>&#8220;I maintain that Truth is a pathless land, and you cannot approach it by any path whatsoever, by any religion, by any sect. That is my point of view, and I adhere to that absolutely and unconditionally. Truth, being limitless, unconditioned, unapproachable by any path whatsoever, cannot be organized; nor should any organization be formed to lead or to coerce people along any particular path.”</em></strong> (Full speech is <a href="http://www.jkrishnamurti.org/about-krishnamurti/dissolution-speech.php">here.</a>)</p><p>Not interested in fame or being worshipped, Krishnamurti cut ties with the Theosophical Society and spent the next 60 years travelling, writing and speaking &#8211; tied to no religion, philosophy or dogma. He left behind a huge body of writing and lectures, much of which can be found at <a href="http://www.jkrishnamurti.org/index.php">Krishnamurti.org</a></p><p><strong>RELATED COMICS</strong><br />
